Feature: Stability check on the chatroom session
  I want to check the stability of holding the chatroom session for 5 minutes

  Scenario: Stability Check
    Given the user is on vpm landing page
    When the creator navigates to "Settings" page
    And the creator selects the server in the Use SL Server option
    When the creator navigates to "Feeds" page
    When the creator enter into the create room form
    Then the creator enter the new room name and start
    Then the creator should have entered into the new room started
    Given the joiner on a vpm landing page
    When the joiner navigates to "Settings" page
    And the joiner selects the server in the Use SL Server option
    When the joiner navigates to "Feeds" page
    When the joiner enter into the join room form
    Then the joiner enter the created room name and start
